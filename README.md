### **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:**

**PROJECT** :  SIMPLE CALCULATOR

**OBJECTIVE:**
The objective of the above code is to create a basic calculator program in Python that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations. The program guides the user through entering two numbers and selecting an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). It then calculates and displays the result of the chosen operation, while handling invalid inputs and division by zero gracefully.

**KEY FEATURES:**
The key activities of the code are:

1. Function Definitions:

- add(a, b): Adds two numbers.
- subtract(a, b): Subtracts the second number from the first.
- multiply(a, b): Multiplies two numbers.
- divide(a, b): Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.

2. User Interaction:

- Welcome Message: Prints a welcome message to the user.
- Input Numbers: Prompts the user to enter two numbers and converts them to floats. Handles invalid input with a message.
- Select Operation: Displays a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and prompts the user to select one.

3. Perform Operation:

- Determine Operation: Based on the user's input, selects the appropriate arithmetic operation.
- Execute Operation: Calls the corresponding function to perform the arithmetic operation on the input numbers.

4. Error Handling:

- Invalid Input: Checks and handles non-numeric input for the numbers.
- Division by Zero: Checks and handles the case where division by zero is attempted.

5. Display Result:

- Prints the result of the arithmetic operation in a formatted string showing the operation and the result.

6. Run the Calculator:

- Calls the calculator() function to start the program.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
The code uses the following technology and features of the Python programming language:

- Python Language: The entire code is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use.

1. Standard Input/Output:

- input(): Used to get input from the user.
- print(): Used to display messages and results to the user.

2. Basic Arithmetic Operations:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

3. Control Structures:

- Conditional Statements: if, elif, and else statements to handle different operations and validate input.
- Error Handling: Simple error handling using try and except blocks to manage invalid numeric input.

4. Functions:

- Custom functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to encapsulate the arithmetic operations.
- Main function (calculator) to manage the overall flow of the program.

No external libraries or advanced Python features are used in this basic calculator program.
